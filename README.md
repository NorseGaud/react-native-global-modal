# react-native-global-modal
A simple implementation of Global Modal using Reanimated.

## How to use it?
To use it in your project, copy everything inside the `src/Modal` folder. This project depends on `react-native-reanimated` V3 so make sure you have that setup. You can find more information about this [here](https://susuthapa19961227.medium.com/global-modal-in-react-native-bff03b8a33).
